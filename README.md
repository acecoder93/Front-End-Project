# Front-End-Project

<h3>The Captain</h3>
Similar to Siri, Alexa, and Cortana, meet your decision-making assistant: The Captain.  He will be the user's assistant in making a decision for a topic that the user inputs. The output can be refined based on certain criteria such as location, preferences, and timing, which will be included in future releases.
