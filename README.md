# Front-End-Project

<h3>The Captain</h3>
Similar to Siri, Alexa, and Cortana, meet your decision-making assistant: The Captain.  He will be the user's assistant in making a decision for a topic that the user inputs. The output can be refined based on certain criteria such as location, preferences, and timing, which will be included in future releases.

The team's goal was to have a contemporary design that enages and targets the current market, as other decision-making games on the web have a rustic or antiquated design. This front-end project was based on developing an minimum-viable-product (MVP) to assist the user to make a decision.
